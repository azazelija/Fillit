# Fillit
Fillit is a project which involves discovering and getting acquainted with a recurrent problem in programming: the search of an optimal solution among a very large number of possibilities in a reasonable amount of time. In this project, you will arrange Tetriminos among them and determine the smallest square that can fit all of them.

## What is it Fillit:

In this project we created a program called fillit wich allow you to take as a parameter a file wich contains a list from 1 to 26 pieces of tetriminos and display, on the standard output, all of them assembled together in the smallest possible square, assigning a capital letter to each tetrimino, starting with ’A’. The main goal is to find the smallest square in the minimal amount of time, despite an exponentially growing number of possibilities each time a piece is added.
